README file for SWOT global CSW simulations:

(i) The grids are built using MATLAB in ...experiments/proc/CSW/global_grids

(ii) The input files are built using MATLAB in directories like .../experiments/proc/CSW/17-5_0.1deg, but the actual files are written to /simulations/CSW/SWOT/17-5_0.1deg. NOTE: This is because "/experiments" is backed-up but "/simulations" is not. I.e., the configuration files will be preserved even if the massive data files are lost.

(iii) The utilized CSW source code (in c) is located in /experiments/proc/CSW/17-5_0.1deg/src, but the output files are, once again, written to "/simulations". A base value of the source code is also stored in "/software"

(iv) The steps to running CSW are:

(1) Generate a grid using MATLAB 

(2) Generate an input file using MATLAB

(3) Compile CSW with the correct file names and dimensions

(4) Run CSW from the command line



To do:
(1) Read in surface tides and phi_bott and calculate forcing in the C-code (should simplify make_input.m)
(2) Compute masks in the time-step routine(?) (should simplify make_input.m and reduce memory by 3 x 8 arrays)
(3) Tag code with checkpoints 1.0 etc.
